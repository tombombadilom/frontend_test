# Store Configuration Interface: Design & Ergonomics Brief

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design and ergonomic requirements for developing a store configuration interface for free-to-play games. The interface consists of two main components:

1. **Player-Facing Store Interface** - The in-game store that players interact with
2. **Administrative Configuration Interface** - The backend system for game editors to manage store content

Based on our analysis of successful game shop interfaces (Fortnite, Genshin Impact, and World of Warcraft), this brief establishes guidelines for creating an intuitive, engaging, and effective store system.

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity & Hierarchy

- Establish clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention
- Use size, color, and positioning to indicate importance
- Ensure information is organized logically and predictably
- Reduce cognitive load through thoughtful information architecture

### 2. Consistency & Coherence

- Maintain consistent design patterns throughout the interface
- Ensure visual elements align with the game's aesthetic
- Use familiar patterns where appropriate to leverage existing mental models
- Create a cohesive experience between store and game environments

### 3. Flexibility & Scalability

- Design systems that can accommodate growing inventories
- Create flexible layouts that adapt to different content types
- Ensure the interface can evolve with changing business requirements
- Support multiple display formats (carousel, grid, infinite scroll)

### 4. Accessibility & Usability

- Design for users of all abilities
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Create touch-friendly targets for mobile interfaces
- Test with diverse user groups to identify usability issues

### 5. Performance & Efficiency

- Optimize for fast loading and response times
- Minimize unnecessary animations or effects that could impact performance
- Create efficient workflows for administrative users
- Balance visual richness with technical constraints

## Player-Facing Store Interface

- **History**: Support for browser history navigation where applicable

#### Micro-interactions

- **Hover states**: Clear feedback when users hover over interactive elements
- **Selection indicators**: Visual confirmation of selected items or filters
- **Loading states**: Informative animations during data retrieval
- **Transition effects**: Smooth, purposeful transitions between states

#### Purchase Flow

- **Cart system**: Ability to collect multiple items before checkout
- **Confirmation steps**: Clear verification before finalizing purchases
- **Success feedback**: Positive reinforcement after successful transactions
- **Error handling**: Helpful guidance when issues occur

## Administrative Configuration Interface

### Dashboard & Overview

- **Store status**: At-a-glance view of current store configuration
- **Key metrics**: Prominent display of important performance indicators
- **Quick actions**: Easy access to common tasks
- **Notifications**: System for alerts about important events or issues

### Content Management

#### Item Editor
