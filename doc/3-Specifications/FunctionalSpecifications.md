## Introduction

This document outlines the functional specifications for the game store configuration interface prototype. It details the core features, user flows, and interaction patterns that will be implemented based on our analysis of existing game stores and design recommendations. These specifications are adapted for a 3-day test project with limited scope.

## Project Constraints

Before detailing the functional specifications, it's important to acknowledge the key constraints of this project:

1. **Timeline**: 3 days for implementation
2. **Scope**: Frontend prototype only, focusing exclusively on what is requested in the instructions
3. **Backend**: No actual backend development; API access will be simulated with JSON files
4. **Administrative Interface**: Conceptual design only, no implementation in the prototype

      "id": "product-1",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "description": "Product description...",
      "price": 1000,
      "discountedPrice": 800,
      "currency": "coins",
      "rarity": "legendary",
      "category": "weapons",
      "subcategory": "swords",
      "tags": ["new", "featured"],
      "imageUrl": "/images/products/product-1.jpg",
      "thumbnailUrl": "/images/products/thumbnails/product-1.jpg",
      "relatedProducts": ["product-2", "product-3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```

## Store Administration Interface

While not implemented in the prototype, a conceptual design for the store administration interface has been created (see `test-frontend/doc/1-Design/AdminInterface.md`). This design outlines:

1. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - Store Administrator
   - Content Manager
   - Analyst

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Product Management
   - Store Layout Configuration
   - Scheduled Updates & Promotions
   - Store Preview Mode
   - Testing & Publishing
   - Analytics Dashboard

3. **User Flows**
   - Product Creation and Publishing
   - Store Layout Configuration
   - Promotion Creation
   - Version Deployment

This conceptual design serves as a blueprint for future development phases.

## Implementation Priorities

Given the 3-day timeline, we will prioritize features in the following order:

### Day 1: Core Structure and Display Modes
1. Basic store layout and navigation
2. Implementation of the three display modes:
   - Grid View
   - Carousel View
   - Infinite Scroll View
3. Category filtering
4. Skeleton loading components for all views

### Day 2: Product Details and Cart
1. Product detail view
2. Add to cart functionality
3. Cart management
4. Display mode switching
5. Skeleton loading states for product details and cart

### Day 3: Refinement and Polish
1. Checkout flow
2. Search functionality
3. Visual polish and animations
4. Responsive design refinements
5. Finalize skeleton loading animations

## Conclusion

These functional specifications provide a framework for implementing the game store configuration interface prototype within the constraints of a 3-day test project. By focusing on the three required display modes (Carousel, Grid, Infinite Scroll) and core functionality, we can create a compelling demonstration of the key concepts from our design recommendations.

The implementation will prioritize:
- The three required display modes
- Skeleton loading states for improved user experience
- Essential shopping functionality
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Responsive design
- Visual polish

By simulating backend functionality with JSON files and focusing exclusively on the requested features, we can deliver a high-quality frontend prototype within the 3-day timeline.
