## Recommendations for Our Interface

### Recommended Animation Effects

   - More elaborate animations reserved for key moments (purchase, rare item)
   - Intelligent asset preloading to reduce wait times
   - Accessibility options to reduce or disable animations

## Conclusion

The analysis of animation effects and navigation structures of these three shop interfaces reveals different approaches, each adapted to the context and audience of the game. Fortnite prioritizes speed and simplicity, Genshin Impact focuses on thematic immersion and excitement, while World of Warcraft offers a more traditional and detailed experience.

For our store configuration interface, we recommend adopting a hybrid approach that combines:
- The fluidity and simplicity of Fortnite
- The thematic immersion and visual feedback of Genshin Impact
- The information richness and preview options of World of Warcraft

This approach will create a purchase experience that is both efficient and engaging, while providing administrators with the necessary tools to configure journeys adapted to different types of games and audiences.
