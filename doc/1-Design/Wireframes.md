## Overview

This document presents wireframe concepts for the three required product display modes in our game store interface:
1. Carousel View
2. Grid View
3. Infinite Scroll View

Each wireframe is accompanied by a rationale explaining the design choices and their suitability for different gaming contexts.

## 1. Carousel View

```

### Key Elements

1. **Large Central Display**: Showcases one product at a time with maximum visual impact
2. **Navigation Arrows**: Allow users to browse through items sequentially
3. **Pagination Indicators**: Show position in the item sequence and allow direct navigation
4. **Featured Items Section**: Displays additional items below the carousel
5. **Product Information**: Prominently displays name, price, and purchase action

### Design Rationale

The Carousel View is designed for:

- **Highlighting Premium Content**: Ideal for showcasing featured or premium items that deserve focused attention
- **Guided Discovery**: Creates a curated shopping experience where each item gets full attention
- **Visual Impact**: Maximizes the visual presentation of each item with large imagery
- **Limited Selection Scenarios**: Works well for daily deals, new releases, or limited-time offers
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintains a similar experience across different screen sizes

This view is particularly effective for games that monetize through high-value cosmetic items or time-limited offers, such as Fortnite's daily item shop. The focused presentation creates a sense of exclusivity and importance for each displayed item.

## 2. Grid View

### Key Elements

1. **Multi-Column Grid**: Displays multiple items simultaneously in a structured layout
2. **Filtering System**: Allows users to refine the displayed items by various criteria
3. **Sorting Options**: Enables users to order items by relevance, price, etc.
4. **Pagination Controls**: Provides navigation between pages of results
5. **Compact Item Cards**: Shows essential information with quick add-to-cart functionality

### Design Rationale

The Grid View is designed for:

- **Efficient Browsing**: Allows users to scan many items quickly
- **Comparison Shopping**: Facilitates easy comparison between multiple items
- **Category Exploration**: Ideal for browsing within specific categories
- **Filter-Driven Discovery**: Supports users who know what they're looking for
- **Inventory Management**: Effective for games with large item catalogs

This approach is well-suited for games like World of Warcraft that have extensive item shops with multiple categories and item types. The grid layout balances information density with visual clarity, making it easy for players to browse large collections efficiently.

## 3. Infinite Scroll View

### Key Elements

1. **Continuous Scrolling**: Items load automatically as the user scrolls down
2. **Detailed Item Cards**: Each item has more space for information and description
3. **Loading Indicator**: Shows when new items are being fetched
4. **Filtering System**: Allows refinement of the infinite list
5. **Horizontal Layout**: Image and details side-by-side for better information scanning

### Design Rationale

The Infinite Scroll View is designed for:

- **Exploration-Focused Shopping**: Encourages discovery through continuous browsing
- **Mobile-Friendly Interaction**: Natural for touch-based scrolling on mobile devices
- **Reduced Interaction Friction**: Eliminates the need for pagination clicks
- **Content-Rich Presentation**: Provides more space for item descriptions and details
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Optimizes performance by loading only what's needed

This approach works particularly well for games like Genshin Impact that have diverse item types requiring more detailed descriptions. The infinite scroll creates a seamless browsing experience that encourages players to discover more items than they might with paginated views.

## Responsive Considerations

All three wireframes will adapt to different screen sizes with the following considerations:

### Mobile Adaptations

- **Carousel**: Maintains similar layout but with touch swipe navigation
- **Grid**: Reduces to 2 columns or 1 column depending on screen width
- **Infinite Scroll**: Stacks image above description for narrower layout

### Tablet Adaptations

- **Carousel**: Similar to desktop but with slightly reduced image size
- **Grid**: 3 columns instead of 4
- **Infinite Scroll**: Similar to desktop with proportionally scaled elements

## Accessibility Considerations

All wireframes incorporate these accessibility features:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labeling and semantic structure
3. **Touch Targets**: Sufficiently sized for users with motor impairments
4. **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards for text readability
5. **Reduced Motion Option**: Alternative to animations for users with vestibular disorders

## Conclusion

Each of these display modes serves different user needs and shopping contexts:

- **Carousel View**: Best for featured items and focused attention
- **Grid View**: Ideal for efficient browsing and comparison
- **Infinite Scroll**: Optimized for exploration and discovery

The implementation will allow users to switch between these views based on their preferences and shopping goals. This flexibility ensures the store interface can adapt to different game contexts, product types, and user behaviors.
