    class A login
    class B decision
    class C,C1 admin
    class D,D1,D2,D3 content
    class E,E1,E2 analyst
```

## Workflow Approval Process

For actions requiring approval, the following workflow is implemented:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CM as Content Manager
    participant NS as Notification System
    participant A as Administrator
    participant S as Store
    
    CM->>S: Submit change for approval
    S->>NS: Generate approval request
    NS->>A: Send notification
    A->>S: Review change
    
    alt Approved
        A->>S: Approve change
        S->>NS: Generate approval notification
        NS->>CM: Send approval notification
        S->>S: Implement change
    else Rejected
        A->>S: Reject change
        S->>NS: Generate rejection notification
        NS->>CM: Send rejection notification
        Note over CM: Make revisions
    end
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implement a robust RBAC system to manage permissions
   - Support for custom roles beyond the three primary roles
   - Granular permission settings for specific features

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all actions performed by users
   - Track changes to permissions and roles
   - Provide visibility into who made what changes and when

3. **Temporary Access**
   - Support for temporary role elevation
   - Time-limited access for specific tasks
   - Emergency access protocols

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Require MFA for administrator accounts
   - Additional verification for sensitive operations
   - Session timeout and security measures
