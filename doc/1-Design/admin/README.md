# Game Store Administration Interface

[← Back to Design](../README.md) | [← Back to Documentation](../../README.md) | [View Documentation Map](../../DocNavigation.md)

## Overview

This directory contains the conceptual design for the store administration interface that allows game editors to manage products, schedule updates, and configure in-game store content efficiently. While this interface will not be implemented as part of the 3-day prototype, this design serves as a blueprint for future development.
